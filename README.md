# me.json – The Digital Representation of a Person

**me.json** is a structured data format designed to serve as a centralized source of personal but non-sensitive information. It provides a standardized and machine-readable way to store details about a person, including biographical data, interests, professional history, and online presence.

## 🌟 Idea & Motivation

Today, personal information is scattered across various platforms – from social media profiles to resumes and private notes. **me.json** creates a unified, easily accessible structure to consolidate this data and use it flexibly.

### 💡 Use Cases

- **Digital Business Card**: Present your professional and personal details in a standardized format.
- **Automated Profiles**: Use the data for websites, APIs, or other digital platforms.
- **Backup & Portability**: Keep your information up-to-date and transportable, independent of specific services.

## 📖 What’s Included in me.json?

The file contains information such as:

- 🏷 **Name & Contact Info** (Email, Phone Number)
- 🌍 **Citizenship & Location**
- 🏢 **Professional Background & Memberships**
- 🎨 **Hobbies & Interests**
- 🎶 **Favorite Music, Movies & Games**
- 🔗 **Online Profiles & Personal Links**

## 🚀 Future Vision

The goal of **me.json** is to define a flexible and open standard that can be easily extended. In the long run, it could be used for **automated profile generation**, **personal assistants**, or **self-managed digital identities**.
